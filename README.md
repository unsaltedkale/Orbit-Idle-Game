## What is Orbit?

Orbit is a relaxing idle game developed for [⛵ Shipwrecked](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/) based on the life cycles of stars. Your star will evolve from a protostar, to a main-squence star, expand as it becomes a giant, and explode in a super-nova!\
\
Throw planets into orbit and watch as your solar system slowly evolves.

## What makes Orbit different than other idle games?

Unlike some idle games which are based in rapid progression and ever-growing numbers, I'm building this game to be something relaxing you can run on a second monitor or in the corner while you work, listen to music, or research more star facts. The only true progression how much mass your star has each life cycle, which can't be upgraded or changed through clicking or interacting-- only time will make your star bigger as you recycle it.   

## What are some features of orbit?
  
⭐ Star evolution!  
⭐ Pretty Art!  
⭐ Different star masses that evolve differently!  
⭐ Differently sized planets that you can throw into orbit!  
⭐ Once your star goes out, recycle your star to make a protostar with more mass!  
⭐ Lots of sliders for customization!
