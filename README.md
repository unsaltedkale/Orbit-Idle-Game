# 🌌☀️🪐 Orbit: A Background Idle Game

###### A video of the alpha version of Orbit. The user slowly zooms out using a zoom slider on the right side, showing many differently-colored planets that all orbit at different speeds and distances around a blue star.

## What is Orbit?

Orbit is a relaxing idle game being developed for [⛵ Shipwrecked](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com/) based on the life cycles of stars. Your star will evolve from a protostar, to a main-squence star, expand as it becomes a giant, and explode in a super-nova! (If your star has enough mass, of course...)\
\
Rouge planets will sometimes wander into your gravity as well. Throw planets into orbit and watch as your solar system slowly evolves in the background.

## What makes Orbit different than other idle games?

Unlike some idle games which are based in rapid progression and ever-growing numbers, I'm building this game to be something relaxing you can run on a second monitor or in the corner while you work, listen to music, or research more star facts. The only true progression how much mass your star has each life cycle, which can't be upgraded or changed through clicking or interacting-- only time will make your star bigger as you recycle it.   

## What are some features of orbit?

Orbit, due to being about astronomy, planets, and orbital mechanics, has taken a lot more time to just get the MVP[^1] stuff down than I expected[^2]. When I ship this, I hope to implement as many features as I possibly can, but, unforunately, I cannot do everything.

#### Some features that will almost definitely exist are:  
  
⭐ Star evolution!  
⭐ Pretty Art!  
⭐ Different star masses that evolve differently!  
⭐ Differently sized planets that you can throw into orbit!  
⭐ Once your star goes out, recycle your star to make a protostar with more mass!  
⭐ A pause button!  
🌟 All based on real star facts!!  

#### Some features that are way less certain, but have *have a tiny chance* to exist are:
⭐ Planetary collisons that can make moons or astroid belts!  
⭐ Highly-customizable settings to tweak your expierience, such as:  
* Slowing down or speeding up the progression of the star, as well as special events  
* Pausing the game automatically when special events happen so you can focus on finishing your task before watching what happens  
* Removing planet collisions! (Because orbits that don't collide are hard)

⭐ Click on your star as it evolves to learn cool star facts about it!  
⭐ Maybe even click on your planets to learn cool planet facts about it!  
⭐ Achievements!  
⭐ Special events like:  
* Binary star systems, or even trinary star systems! (if you have enough mass)  
* Comets!  
* Binary or trinary planet systems!

🌟 And rare chance some familar planets might wander in for you to rehome...
