# ‚òÄÔ∏èü™ê Orbit: A Background Idle Game

## What is Orbit?

Orbit is a relaxing idle game based on the life cycles of stars. 

## What makes Orbit different than all the other idle games?

Unlike some idle games which are based in rapid progression and ever-growing numbers, this game is more like a fun application that looks cool to have running in the background while you work, listen to music, or any other fun things you might do.  
I hope to impliment settings to let the user customize their own interaction with Orbit. Things like: 
- Slowing down or speeding up of the lifespan of the star
- Pausing the game automatically before an important event happens so you don't miss it while you focus on something
- Even removing planet collisions entirely<sup>(If I even have the time to make that :fearful:)</sup>




Orbit is a relaxing idle game based on the life cycles of stars. Throw planets into orbit and watch as your solar system slowly evolves in the background.
